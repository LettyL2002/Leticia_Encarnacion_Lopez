I don't like anyone listening to the songs that I write. Emma? They're for me. Little Voice was the idea of wanting to return to this phase in my life. When I was in my early 20s, I had to embody this idea of trusting my own voice. I just don't have that thing. What you're feeling now, use it. You're gonna make a great song. I think what's interesting about Sarah's work is they were really inspired by very small personal things that were happening in her life. And that really interested me on a writing level. To have a show where music is at the core of it was a wonderful thing because the music was informing the story as much as the story was informing the music. You're a great songwriter. Tell them what inspired them. I really loved getting to know Brittany through the music of the show. I grew up playing piano, so I had the basic skills. But Sarah gave great advice when it comes to singing. She taught me how to play guitar. I started playing things I never thought I could play. When we started singing together, I think that's when we realized we have a lot of musical chemistry. She came with such a spirit of collaboration. That's such an element of who Bess is. As my dad always said, sometimes you just gotta do it for the love of it. Sarah talked about New York as being the kind of heartbeat of the show. It's a place that is just full with opportunity. You're hearing songs everywhere. From the subway buskers to people in the park, the sounds and the rhythms of the city are so alive and vital. It certainly was a huge part of my musical journey. Give me some swagger.
